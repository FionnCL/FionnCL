# About Me

Hey! My name is Fionn Camacho Lenihan🇲🇽🇮🇪. I am currently in my final year at Trinity College Dublin.

I quite like programming tbh... Maybe I'll make a career out of it some day 🤔.

I have an interest in any field of Softare Engineering where one must apply themself.

# Portfolio

I have a [portfolio website](https://fionncl.web.app/) btw, check it out for more information on past work and projects I've taken part in.
